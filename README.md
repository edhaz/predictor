# Predictor

## What's this all about?

This is a project for me to work on to learn more about making machine learning models and at the same time being able to predict upcoming sports matches (probably rugby, my favourite sport to watch).

## General idea

Create some sort of tensorflow model using the data (perhaps just scorelines to start with, but moving onto more in depth data if possible) from rugby matches to see if there's anything that can predict the outcome.

## What should the output be?

Some swanky graphs on a web app showing the chances of teams winning upcoming fixtures.

This can then be compared against actual results to check the accuracy.

## Tasks

- [ ] Access data
- [ ] Create model
- [ ] Display output
